# proxmox-DRS

As proxmox project doesn't support load balancing Vms and CTs over cluster as OpenStack Nova-Scheduler And vSphere DRS do.
The main purpose for the LB is:

    Provide highly available resources to your workloads.
    Balance workloads for optimal performance.
    Scale and manage computing resources without service disruption.
  
I start a simple project for community purpose to implement a Proxmox DRS, basically, i start by implement the algorithm in the document here:

All propositions are welcome, it can be by coding or providing ideas.
Thank you
